<!DOCTYPE html><meta charset="utf-8"><p><strong>Code Wise</strong> is a Visual Studio Code extension that automatically <strong>analyzes</strong> your codebase at pre-commit, leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Ollama, Mistral, and others. It helps developers identify <strong>architectural</strong> improvements, <strong>SOLID</strong> principle violations, <strong>code smells</strong>, and suggest <strong>design patterns</strong> — all seamlessly integrated into their daily workflow.</p><h3 id="overview">Overview</h3><p>Once installed and configured, CodeWise operates silently in the background. It monitors your Git repository for new commits and automatically triggers a set of intelligent agents that review the code changes, offering structured, insightful feedback saved directly into your workspace.</p><ol><li><p>Install the extension locally</p></li><li><p>Configure your .env file with the appropriate LLM credentials: (name of your provider)_API_KEY=your-api-key (ex.

It analyzes code files changed in the commit and sends a file (commit_analysis_report.md) with analysis about performance and code smell suggestions to the root of projects.</p><h3 id="workflow-breakdown">Workflow Breakdown</h3><p>The following steps describe the internal process behind CodeWise:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Git Commit Detection</strong><br>CodeWise watches the <code>.git/logs/HEAD</code> file to detect when a new commit is made. This enables real-time, non-intrusive monitoring of commit activity without requiring Git hooks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Extract Commit Information</strong><br>Once a commit is detected, the system extracts:</p><ul><li>Commit hash, author, date, and message</li><li>Changed files and corresponding diffs</li></ul><p>This information is formatted and saved in a temporary file (<code>gitInput.txt</code>) to serve as input for the language models.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invoke LLM Agents in Parallel</strong><br>CodeWise leverages a set of specialized agents (built on top of LangChain + LangGraph), each trained to analyze a specific dimension of the codebase:</p><ul><li><strong>Architect Agent</strong>: Analyzes folder structure and determines the architectural pattern used (e.g., MVC, Clean Architecture).</li><li><strong>Integration Agent</strong>: Reviews module coupling and suggests integration improvements.</li><li><strong>SOLID Agent</strong>: Detects violations of SOLID principles and proposes corrections.</li><li><strong>Framework Analyst</strong>: Suggests alternative frameworks or improvements in the usage of existing ones.</li><li><strong>Design Pattern Advisor</strong>: Recommends design patterns suitable for scalability, reusability, or maintainability.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Merge Results into Markdown Report</strong><br>The results from all LLMs are aggregated into a structured markdown report (<code>commit_analysis_report.md</code>), which includes individual sections for each agent’s findings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clean Up and Await Next Commit</strong><br>After the report is generated, temporary files are deleted and the extension continues monitoring for future commits.</p></li></ol><p>This automated cycle ensures that every commit is reviewed by AI before it even reaches the remote repository — enabling proactive quality control and faster feedback for developers.</p><h3 id="features">Features</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Pre-commit Code Analysis</strong><br>Automatically analyzes code right after a local commit is made, ensuring issues are caught before pushing to the repository.</p></li><li><p><strong>LLM-Based Multi-Agent Architecture</strong><br>Utilizes multiple specialized Language Model agents (Architect, Integration Analyst, SOLID Reviewer, Design Pattern Advisor, etc.) working in parallel for deep, context-aware code evaluation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Support for Multiple LLM Providers</strong><br>Compatible with various LLM providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Ollama, Mistral, Groq, Cohere, and more) with plug-and-play extensibility via a factory pattern and reflection-based dynamic loading.</p></li><li><p><strong>Automatic Report Generation</strong><br>Produces a detailed markdown report (<code>commit_analysis_report.md</code>) after each commit, summarizing architectural insights, design flaws, and suggestions.</p></li><li><p><strong>No User Disruption</strong><br>Fully background operation – developers commit code as usual while CodeWise silently processes and reports.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-language Project Support</strong><br>Can analyze projects written in multiple programming languages, especially those structured around standard architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, DDD).</p></li><li><p><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong><br>Designed to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments (as long as Node.js and VS Code are installed).</p></li><li><p><strong>Modular and Extensible Design</strong><br>Easy to extend with new agent roles, models, or analysis types using a clean and maintainable architecture.</p></li><li><p><strong>CI/CD Ready</strong><br>CodeWise is built to support packaging and publishing via GitHub Actions, enabling streamlined deployment of new versions.</p></li></ul><h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3><ul><li><p>“@types/node”: “20.x”</p></li><li><p>“typescript”: “^5.8.3”</p></li><li><p>“node.js”: “^v20.18.0”</p></li><li><p>“npm”: “^11.4.1”</p></li><li><p>Visual Studio Code (v1.85+)</p></li></ul><h3 id="usage">Usage</h3><p>Once installed and activated, CodeWise automatically monitors your Git workspace for new commits. When a commit is made, the extension triggers a background process that analyzes the committed code and generates a comprehensive report with architectural insights and improvement suggestions.</p><p>Follow these steps to use CodeWise:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Open a Git-based project in VS Code.</strong><br>Ensure the project is tracked by Git and has at least one workspace folder opened.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make a commit.</strong><br>When you commit code, CodeWise detects the change and analyzes it automatically.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wait for the analysis.</strong><br>Within seconds, CodeWise runs a set of LLM agents to analyze your code based on architecture, integration, design patterns, SOLID principles, and framework usage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Check the output report.</strong><br>A new file named <code>commit_analysis_report.md</code> will be created in the root of your project, containing a detailed summary of findings and suggestions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Review and refactor.</strong><br>Open the report to review the suggestions. Use the insights to refactor and improve your code quality before pushing to remote repositories.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>The process is fully automated and non-intrusive. Developers commit code as usual; CodeWise works silently in the background.</p></blockquote>
