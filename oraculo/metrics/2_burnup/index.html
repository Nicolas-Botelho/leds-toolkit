Thus, the Burnup chart will be built based on the accumulation of closed issues in relation to the total planned for each sprint.</p><h3 id="-project-impact">ðŸŒŸ Project impact:</h3><p>The Burnup allows us to compare the flow of incoming issues in the project with their resolution, evaluating the development teamâ€™s ability to complete tasks within the expected timeframe. From this metric, itâ€™s possible to estimate a satisfactory volume of new issues to be defined in a sprint and to identify deviations such as delays or an increase in tasks.</p>
