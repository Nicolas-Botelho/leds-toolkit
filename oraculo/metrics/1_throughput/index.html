Monitoring will be continuous, and the results will be consolidated at the end of each development cycle, allowing us to identify the actual delivery volume of the team.</p><h3 id="-project-impact">ðŸŒŸ Project impact:</h3><p>Throughput provides a clear view of the teamâ€™s productivity, helping to determine the ideal amount of work per sprint. By tracking this metric, it is possible to identify performance trends, adjust team capacity, and detect workflow bottlenecks. This directly contributes to more accurate planning and continuous improvement of project processes.</p>
