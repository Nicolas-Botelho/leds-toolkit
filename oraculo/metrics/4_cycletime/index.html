This time covers the active development phase, without considering periods of waiting or inactivity. The analysis will be continuous, and the results will be reviewed at the end of each sprint to identify variations in development time.</p><h3 id="-project-impact">ðŸŒŸ Project impact:</h3><p>Cycle time is an essential metric for evaluating the efficiency of the development process. By monitoring it, the team can identify where delays are occurring in the workflow and adjust processes to reduce cycle time. This results in faster deliveries and helps increase the teamâ€™s ability to handle more tasks simultaneously, optimizing the overall project performance.</p>
