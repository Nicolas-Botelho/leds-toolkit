This time represents the full work cycle for each item. Monitoring will be continuous, and the data will be analyzed at the end of each sprint, making it possible to evaluate the average delivery time for demands.</p><h3 id="-project-impact">ðŸŒŸ Project impact:</h3><p>Lead time provides a clear view of the delivery processâ€™s agility. By tracking this metric, it becomes possible to identify delays, understand where bottlenecks occur, and improve delivery predictability. This strengthens commitment to deadlines, increases transparency with stakeholders, and supports decision-making to optimize the teamâ€™s workflow.</p>
