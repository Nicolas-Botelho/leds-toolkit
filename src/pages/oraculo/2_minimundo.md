Presents the project`s scope and problem context.

# Oráculo

# Mini-World

## Context

In software development teams, project information is often spread across **GitHub repositories**, where tasks, issues, and pull requests are managed.  
Analyzing this data manually is time-consuming and makes it difficult to obtain a clear and real-time view of the project’s progress.  
This causes problems such as:  
- Difficulty in identifying pending tasks and bottlenecks.  
- Lack of agility in tracking team performance.  
- Limited visibility for managers and advisors to support decision-making.  

The **Oráculo** system was created to address these challenges by using **AI** to transform raw GitHub data into **natural language answers**.

---

## Target System

- **Tool**: Oráculo (Chatbot System).  
- **Main functions to be validated**:  
  - Extract and organize data from GitHub repositories.  
  - Allow queries in natural language about project status.  
  - Provide clear insights into sprint progress and team performance.  
  - Ensure transparency and agility in project management.  

---

## Objectives

- Provide a **real-time view of project progress**.  
- Support managers in **decision-making**.  
- Facilitate **performance tracking** of teams and individuals.  

---

## Rules and Restrictions

- Must extract data from **GitHub repositories**.  
- Queries must be answered through **natural language processing (NLP)**.  
- Data must be stored and structured in a **PostgreSQL database**.  
- System must ensure **transparency and reliability** in the information provided.
