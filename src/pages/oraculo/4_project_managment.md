## 🧩 Project Model Canvas

### 🔍 Justifications
1. Ease github data visualization via LLM chat.

---

### 🎯 Product
Oráculo improvement.

---

### 🧠 SMART Goal
Improve Oráculo overall usability and chat experience in up to 4 months with 3 managers and 3 developers.

---

### ✅ Requirements
- User must be able to add repositories through a screen;  
- LLM should have memory, for context storage;  
- User acess must be restricted to their respective repositories;

---

### 🎁 Benefits
- Flexibility in importing data from multiple repositories while running;
- Time optimization when analyzing project progress.

---

### 👥 External Stakeholders & Factors
Advisors, scholarship holders, staff, and other stakeholders involved in LEDS and FAPES.

---

### 🔮 Assumptions
- There will be access to AWS servers;
- Use of Open-source dependencies.
- Improvements implemented in 4 months.

---

### ⚠️ Risks

#### 1. Lack of technical capacity of the developers  
- **Probability**: 70%  
- **Mitigation**: Rething the delivery deadlines.

#### 2. Project complexity being increased by Paulo Sergio  
- **Probability**: 50%  

#### 3. Withdrawal of team members  
- **Probability**: 20%  

#### 4. Unaccessible dependencies  
- **Probability**: 5%  
- **Mitigation**: Search and study replacement dependencies.

---

### 📦 Deliverables

#### Management:
- Results with collected metrics  

#### Developers:
- Dynamic Data Import;
- LLM Memory Implementation;
- Centralized Data and Access Control;
- LLM Answers Generating Graphical Data.

---

### ⛓ Constraints
- Delivery deadline: 4 months.

---

### 🗓 Timeline
- First delivery:  31/08
- Second delivery: 28/09
- Third delivery:  02/11
- Fourth delivery: 30/11

### 💰 Costs

- **Developer Cost**: R$1,000.00 × 7 members = **R$7,000.00**  
- **AWS Hosting Cost (4 months)**: R$ 5.0 × 120 days × 7 members= **R$4,200.00**  
- **Gemini API Cost**: R$12.00 × 120 days × 7 members = **R$10,080.00**
