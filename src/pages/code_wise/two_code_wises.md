# Code Wise Documentation

There are two tools named **Code Wise**. To avoid confusion, we will refer to them as **Code Wise Lib** and **Code Wise Extension**. Below is a brief description of each:

## Code Wise Extension
**Code Wise Extension** is a Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extension that uses AI to analyze code, identifying **architectural** improvements, **SOLID** principle violations, **code smells**, and suggesting **design patterns**.

## Code Wise Lib
**Code Wise Lib** is a Python library that uses AI to analyze code and automate Pull Request documentation through Git hooks.
