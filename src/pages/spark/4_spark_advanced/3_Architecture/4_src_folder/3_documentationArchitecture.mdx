# Generated Documentation
In addition to generate the code, Spark can automatically generate basic documentation for the modules and classes defined in a Spark file.

## Generated Hierarchy
### Package Diagram
- A PlantUML file named packagediagram.puml is generated, containing all packages in the Spark file; and
- A corresponding Markdown file is also created, which embeds the package diagram and lists all of it's packages.

### Packages
For each package (also referred to as a module), Spark creates a dedicated folder.
Each folder contains:
- classdiagram.puml: a PlantUML file describing the classes within the package, including their attributes and relationships.
- A Markdown file documenting the classes in the package, similar in structure to the package diagram file.

## Terminology Note
In the documentation, the terms packages and classes are used.
However, in Spark grammar these are referred to as modules and entities, respectively.
In other words:
- *Package = Module*  
- *Class = Entity*
