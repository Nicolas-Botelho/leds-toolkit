# Overview

**Andes (Analysis as Code)** is a tool that helps Software Requirements Engineers model requirements, use cases, and actors, including their interrelations. From these models, Andes automatically generates:

- **Markdown documentation** with requirements, use cases, and actors;  
- **End-to-end test cases** in Gherkin language;  
- **Documents for Made**, assisting in project management;  
- **Documents for Spark**, supporting software development.  

With Andes, you transform requirements models into ready-to-use documentation and tests, saving time and reducing errors.
