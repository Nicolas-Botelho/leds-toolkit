Furthermore, within the context of this level in the CLI folder, each subfolder refers to a specific command and, depending on the layer, may include subdirectories for more specific application configurations.</p><p>With these mechanisms, the code becomes not only extremely organized but also allows a clear visualization of the internal layer architectures without the need for diagramming.</p><h1 id="understanding-the-generate-structure-better">Understanding the Generate Structure Better</h1><p>Consider the following example code:</p><pre class="astro-code github-dark" data-language="plaintext" style="background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8;overflow-x:auto" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span>Configuration {</span></span>

In this structure, we have the folders:</p><ul><li>documentation;</li><li>backend;</li><li>frontend; and</li><li>opa.</li></ul><p>The commands registered in VSCode are:</p><ul><li>generate project documentation;</li><li>generate backend;</li><li>generate frontend; and</li><li>generate authorization; Sound familiar?.</li></ul><p>Thus, each folder represents a command registered in VSCode.</p><p>When a command is triggered, its specific generate file is located within the folder structure. Suppose you execute the command generate backend. Then, VSCode will call the Generator.ts file inside the CLI folder and pass the parameters defined in the configuration section of the .spark file. The Generator.ts file will then locate the specific generate file corresponding to the provided parametersâ€”in our case, it accesses the backend folder (as the generation command is generate backend), then accesses the python folder (as specified in the project configuration), and finally calls the generate.ts file.</p><p>The generate.ts file, in turn, understands its internal structure and proceeds to create the necessary folders at its level, continuing to call the respective generate.ts files at lower levels, until the entire folder structure is properly built. As the folders are created, the files belonging to each level are also generated.
