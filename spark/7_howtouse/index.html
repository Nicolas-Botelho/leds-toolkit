<!DOCTYPE html><meta charset="utf-8"><ol start="0"><li>(Prerequisite): Ensure that the Leds - Spark - Beta extension is installed in your VSCode editor. This extension is available through the editor’s built-in extension marketplace. It is required to leverage Spark’s features without the need to import libraries locally into your project. Note that it differs from the Spark - LEDS extension, which is also available in the same marketplace. Unlike the latter, Leds - Spark - Beta relies on an external library that unifies backend and frontend generation with a greater decoupling of responsibilities from Langium. The library, in turn, is responsible for decoupling business logic from the extension’s core repository, enabling reuse without compromising the main generation functionality.</li><li>Create a file with extension <code>.spark</code> (e.g., slave_one.spark)</li><li>Define the <a href="6_lang.md">class diagram</a></li><li>Save the file <code>.spark</code></li><li>Click with right botton and chose one option <img alt="Menu com opções de geração ao clicar com botão direito" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" height="625" loading="lazy" src="/_astro/right-click.D4jvoVFJ_2eWr2P.webp" width="554"></li><li>After that, Spark will generate the software artifacts <img alt="Exemplo de hierarquia de pastas gerada" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" height="223" loading="lazy" src="/_astro/folders.D_I1cVwk_Z1KSuHF.webp" width="378"></li></ol>
